# AI Coding Stats MCP Protocol

This project uses the `ai-coding-stats` MCP server to record AI Coding round statistics.

At the end of every normal AI Coding round, call the MCP tool `record_ai_coding_round`.

For a request whose main purpose is to undo or revert a previous round's code changes, call `record_ai_coding_round_revert` instead of `record_ai_coding_round`.

## Recording Rule

After completing each user request, call `record_ai_coding_round` before the final response.

Use `record_ai_coding_round` for normal implementation, investigation, and documentation rounds. Use `record_ai_coding_round_revert` for revert rounds.

Record even when no code changed.

If the MCP call fails or the server is unavailable, say so briefly in the final response.

## Requirement Id

Pass the user's prompt as `promptText`.

Markers like `#12` are parsed by the MCP server as requirement id `12`.

When the prompt has no marker, still call the tool. The MCP server will reuse the previous requirement id for the same `conversationId`.

When there is no marker and no context, the requirement id remains empty.

## conversationId

Use a stable id for the current conversation:

```text
codex:<absolute project path>
```

Keep the same `conversationId` throughout the conversation. This is required for requirement id inheritance.

## Timing

At the start of a user request, remember `startedAt` as an ISO 8601 timestamp.

At the end, set `endedAt` to the current ISO 8601 timestamp.

## Code Change Stats

Before making edits, note the worktree baseline.

At the end, use git stats when available:

```bash
git diff --numstat
```

Fill:

- `filesChanged`
- `linesAdded`
- `linesDeleted`
- `codeLinesChanged = linesAdded + linesDeleted`

If exact per-round stats are not available, use the best available estimate and set `metadata.codeStatsSource`.

## Token Stats

Use actual token counts if available.

If token counts are unavailable, set token fields to `0` and set `metadata.tokenStatsUnavailable = true`.

## Tool Payload

Use this shape:

```json
{
  "conversationId": "codex:/absolute/project/path",
  "startedAt": "ISO-8601 start time",
  "endedAt": "ISO-8601 end time",
  "modelName": "current model name",
  "promptText": "original user prompt",
  "filesChanged": 0,
  "linesAdded": 0,
  "linesDeleted": 0,
  "codeLinesChanged": 0,
  "inputTokens": 0,
  "outputTokens": 0,
  "totalTokens": 0,
  "metadata": {
    "client": "codex",
    "projectPath": "/absolute/project/path",
    "threadId": "current Codex thread id when available",
    "turnId": "current Codex turn id when available",
    "codeStatsSource": "git diff --numstat",
    "tokenStatsUnavailable": true
  }
}
```

If actual token counts are unavailable, preserve any available Codex `threadId` and `turnId` in `metadata`. The token sync job uses them to recover real token usage from Codex logs without ambiguous time-window matching.

## Reverting A Round

If the user asks to undo or revert the code changes from a previous round, first revert the code in the worktree using the safest project-appropriate method.

After the code revert is complete, call `record_ai_coding_round_revert` instead of `record_ai_coding_round`.

Do not delete or overwrite the original `record_ai_coding_round` row. The MCP server preserves it for audit and excludes it from effective statistics through `ai_coding_effective_rounds`.

Use `targetRoundId` when the id returned by the original `record_ai_coding_round` call is known.

If `targetRoundId` is not known and the user asked to revert the latest round in this conversation, omit `targetRoundId`; the MCP server will mark the latest active round for the same `conversationId` as reverted.

Payload shape:

```json
{
  "conversationId": "codex:/absolute/project/path",
  "targetRoundId": 123,
  "revertedAt": "ISO-8601 revert completion time",
  "modelName": "current model name",
  "promptText": "original revert request prompt",
  "reason": "user requested undo",
  "filesChanged": 0,
  "linesAdded": 0,
  "linesDeleted": 0,
  "codeLinesChanged": 0,
  "inputTokens": 0,
  "outputTokens": 0,
  "totalTokens": 0,
  "metadata": {
    "client": "codex",
    "projectPath": "/absolute/project/path",
    "revertTarget": "latest active round when targetRoundId is omitted",
    "tokenStatsUnavailable": true
  }
}
```
